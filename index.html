<p>
    The Appropriate Software Foundation is an established micro-consultancy for
    software architecture and development. It is a company registered in England and
    Wales (#04977110) and limited by guarantee. Our registered address is 34 Market
    Street, Hyde, Cheshire, SK14 1AH.
</p>

<p>
    Operating since 1999, we support human process with working software. We work
    internationally, with public and private sector organisations, governmental and
    non-governmental organisations, international agencies and community based
    organisations. The Appropriate Software Foundation is incorporated as a non-profit
    organisation. We do not receive grants. Our staff costs are covered by
    clients engaging with our consulting services.

<p>
    In the background, we have been working towards grounding our project work in a
    universal approach to supporting human process with working software, something
    everybody can use to approach any shared situation. We want to create a world
    in which everybody can recognise each other as human developers. Through our
    experience working across a broad range of domains, we have come to feel the
    modern and effective approach to developing software and human process is to
    model and propose "what happens" as "occasions of experience". As Alfred North
    Whitehead wrote in Process and Reality, "the actual world is built up of actual
    occasions". It seems to us the difficulty with the classical analysis of object
    orientation, of the agile manifesto, of the patterns of enterprise application
    architecture, and even the original version of domain driven design is, on one
    hand, their involvement with the substance-quality categories, and on the other
    hand, the failure to understand what is an event. With that recognition, we want
    to move away classical analysis and using CRUD by default, and also away from
    the agile manifesto, because even its name invokes the substance-quality categories.
    There aren't any agile teams or organisations or people or coaches because there
    is no such thing as an agile event: events merely become and then perish and never
    really are. In that sense, the Appropriate Software Foundation is currently
    becoming increasingly event-oriented.
