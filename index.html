<h1>Appropriate Software Foundation</h1>
<p>The Appropriate Software Foundation is an established micro-consultancy for
software architecture and development registered in the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>Operating since 1999, we support human process with working software. Through our
experience working across a broad range of domains, we have found the best approach
to the development of software, and of a human process, is understanding "the
actual world is built up of actual occasions".
