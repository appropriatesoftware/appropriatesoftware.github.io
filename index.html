<h1>Appropriate Software Foundation</h1>
The Appropriate Software Foundation is a micro-consultancy based in London, UK.

Operating since 1999, we support human process with working software. Through our
experience working across a broad range of domains, we find the most appropriate
approach to both the development of software and the development of a human process
is to understand "the actual world is built up of actual occasions".
