        The Appropriate Software Foundation is a micro-consultancy for
        software architecture and development.

    <p>
        Operating since 1999, we help support human process with working software. We work
        internationally, with public and private sector organisations, governmental and
        non-governmental organisations, international agencies and community based
        organisations. The Appropriate Software Foundation is incorporated as a non-profit
        organisation. Our staff costs are covered entirely by clients engaging with our
        consulting services.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have also been working towards grounding our client work in a
        universal approach to supporting human process with working software, something
        everyone can use to improve any shared situation. We want to live in a world
        where we can relate to each other as world developers. Through our
        experience working across a broad range of domains, we have come to feel the
        best approach to the development of software systems and of human process is to
        model and propose "what happens". As Alfred North Whitehead wrote in Process and
        Reality, "the actual world is built up of actual occasions". It seems to us the
        difficulty with the classical analysis of object orientated programming, for example
        Martin Fowler's Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, is, on one hand,
        the involvement of the substance-quality categories, and on the other hand, the failure
        to understand the modern process philosophy of events. With that recognition, we want
        to move away from the classical analysis and using CRUD by default. We also want to move away
        from the Agile Manifesto, because process is not less valuable than people but is
        rather the attainment of a final end that makes a person and a software system whatever
        it happens to be, and because it fails to contribute sufficient determination to events
        so that even after twenty years we can't be sure quite what will be happening in any given
        "agile" project. For these reasons, the Appropriate Software Foundation is becoming
        increasingly event-oriented.
