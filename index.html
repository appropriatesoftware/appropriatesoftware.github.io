    <h1>Appropriate Software Foundation</h1>

        Operating since 2003, we help support human process with working software. We work
        internationally, with public and private sector organisations, governmental and
        non-governmental organisations, international agencies and community based
        organisations.
        The Appropriate Software Foundation was incorporated as a
        not-for-profit company, with the core objective to develop open source software
        that supports social processes and human development. We remain committed to that
        objective.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have also been working towards grounding our client work in a
        universal approach to supporting human process with working software, something
        everyone can use to improve any shared situation. We want to live in a world
        where we can relate to each other as world developers. Through our
        experience of working across a broad range of domains, we have come to feel the
        best approach to the development of software systems and of human process is to
        model and propose "what happens" (actual occasions of experience). As Alfred North
        Whitehead has it in Process and Reality, "the actual world is built up of actual
        occasions".
    </p>
    <p>
        It seems to us now, the difficulty with the classical analysis of object
        orientated programming is, on one hand, the involvement of the substance-quality
        categories and, on the other hand, the failure to understand the modern process
        philosophy of events. And so want to move away from the classical
        analysis and from using CRUD by default.
        We also want to move away from the Agile approach, because process is not less
        valuable than individuals and interactions but is rather the attainment of a final
        end that makes an individual and an interaction (and a software system) whatever it
        happens to be. The Agile manifesto fails to contribute sufficient determination
        to events, so that even after twenty years we can't be sure quite what will be happening
        in any given "agile" project. For these reasons, the Appropriate Software Foundation
        is becoming increasingly event-oriented.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our "flagship" project is the <a href="https://eventsourcing.readthedocs.io/">library
        for event sourcing in Python</a>, a persistence mechanism for domain
        driven design with examples that show how to develop distributed systems that
        are reliable, scalable, and maintainable.
